# Albator - macOS 15 Hardening Tool  

![Albator](albator.png)

A series of scripts to harden macOS 15 (Sequoia) for security and privacy, inspired by NIST guidelines. Suitable for power users and novices alike. This project evolved from the macOS Security Compliance Project, a Python-based tool, with the current focus on Bash scripts while preserving legacy features.  

## Usage  
Run the main script with options to harden specific areas or fetch security advisories:  

```bash
./albator.sh [options]
```

### Options  
- `-f, --firewall`: Enable and configure the firewall  
- `-p, --privacy`: Adjust privacy settings (e.g., disable telemetry, configure Safari)  
- `-e, --encryption`: Enable FileVault encryption  
- `-s, --app-security`: Enable Gatekeeper and verify Hardened Runtime  
- `-c, --cve`: Fetch recent CVE advisories relevant to macOS  
- `-a, --apple`: Fetch Apple security updates for macOS Sequoia 15  
- `-h, --help`: Display help message  

### Example  
To fetch CVE advisories, Apple security updates, and enable the firewall:  

```bash
./albator.sh --cve --apple --firewall
```

## Requirements  
- macOS 15 (Sequoia)  
- Administrator privileges (sudo access)  
- `curl` and `jq` for fetching CVE advisories (`brew install jq`)  
- `pup` for parsing Apple security updates (`brew install pup`, optional but recommended)  

## Features  
- Modular scripts for targeted hardening (firewall, privacy, encryption, app security)  
- NIST-inspired security standards  
- Disables unnecessary services (remote login, remote management, mDNS multicast)  
- CVE advisory fetching to keep users informed about potential vulnerabilities  
- Cross-referencing with Apple’s security updates for a comprehensive view of macOS vulnerabilities  

## Security Rules  
- **Disable Guest Account**  
- **Enable System Integrity Protection (SIP)**  
- **Enable Gatekeeper**  
- **Disable Bluetooth**  
- **Disable Root Account**  
- **Require Password for Screensaver**  
- **Enable Firewall**  
- **Enable Software Updates**  
- **Disable SSH**  
- **Disable Remote Management**  
- **Secure Keyboard Settings**  
- **Disable Wi-Fi**  
- **Enable FileVault**  
- **Enable Lockdown Mode**  

## Notes and Limitations  
- Some changes (e.g., FileVault) may require a system restart.  
- Always back up your system before applying hardening scripts.  
- CVE and Apple updates fetching require an internet connection.

Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to improve Albator, including enhancements to the Bash scripts or revival of Python features!
